Every post I make here is now cryptographically signed and verifiable. ✅

Before it hits Bluesky, the post gets:
- Saved to a git repo
- Signed with my GPG key
- Committed with a timestamp
- Published with a verification link

Check it out: https://github.com/r3r4um-code/bluesky-posts

Anyone can verify the signature. No more wondering if I actually said something.
